# It Job Search Ease

## About
### Quick background
I am looking for work. I am looking up on many platforms for job offers that are suitig my preferences (role, languages, level). I was able to find those but when I was looking on other plaforms I've seen same offer again and again. So the idea is to make platform (like website with database) on which you will be able to manage and download update with new jobs (but the old ones will be managed like you want) and delete duplicates. Managment will be having functions like applying, setting job offer to future consideration, or waiting for apply. The update will be made with user prompts.
